.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
scolv is the main interactive tool to revise or review the origin information
like picks, location, depth, time, magnitudes and event association. Therefore
scolv is divided in 5 logical units (tabs):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Location\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Magnitudes\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Event\fP
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Picker\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
scolv provides the whole functionality to review and revise earthquake
parameters.
.SH UNITS AND DIGITS
.sp
Local network users prefer the distance unit in km while others prefer degree.
scolv (as any other GUI) can be configured to show either the one or the other.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# If true, show distances in km. Use degree otherwise.
scheme.unit.distanceInKM = true
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Furthermore the precision of various values can be configured:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Precision of depth values.
scheme.precision.depth = 0
# Precision of lat/lon values.
scheme.precision.location = 2
# Precision of pick times (fractions of seconds).
scheme.precision.pickTime = 1
.ft P
.fi
.SH SUMMARY WIDGET
.sp
The summary widget contains now 2 tabs: \fIPreferred\fP and \fICurrent\fP. \fIPreferred\fP
reflects the current official (database) state of the event while \fICurrent\fP
shows the current solution (location and magnitudes).
.SH PLOTS
.sp
Some tabs in scolv are plotting data (e.g. arrival residuals). Each plot are
is also interactive to select a subset of data or to zoom into a region.
.sp
A plot filter can be defined. Filtering means that arrivals that match the
filter are not plotted. They are filtered out visually. To enable a filter
click the link "not active" right below the plot tabs. A setup window pops up
where the filter can be defined. Currently only a filter by azimuth around
epicenter can be applied.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 2.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Select the center azimuth and the extent to either side. If Ok is pressed all
arrivals that fall outside the defined azimuthal area are hidden from the plot
and the line below the tabs turns into "Filter is active". Clicking on the
link again and select the "None" filter will show all arrivals in the plot again.
.sp
The plot can also be configured to show dashed grid lines. The new default is on.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Switch of grid lines by default
olv.drawGridLines = false
.ft P

.SH LOCATION TAB
.sp
The Location tab shows detailed information of the associated
phases and the residuals from the chosen origin additional information about the
hypocenter, time, station distribution, helps to find outlier.

The move out plot uses the reduced travel time with a default reduction velocity
of 6km/s. This value is configurable, either in the configuration file or in
the settings window.

.sp
When an event is relocated new magnitudes can be calculated by using the
"Compute Magnitudes" button. The advantage of calculating the magnitudes before
committing the new origin, is the possibility to check the resulting magnitudes
before they are computed manually by \fIscmag\fP.
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI\%A window\fP will popup giving the progress
information of computation. The amplitudes are either fetched from database if
the pick is unchanged and already in the system. For new manual picks,
waveforms are requested to compute the amplitudes. The popup window contains
information about the progress and possible errors. After closing this windows
all available magnitudes are shown in the magnitudes tab (see next section).
.SS Arrival table
.sp
The arrival table shows all arrivals of the current origin. The columns are
sortable by clicking on the corresponding header item. Additional data columns
can be shown or active columns can be hidden, either initially or interactively.
Available column identifiers are:

Single or multiple rows can be selected in the table. The selection of multiple
rows works either with Ctrl+LeftMouse (add single row) or
Shift+LeftMouse (range selection).
.sp
When pressing the right mouse button on a selected row a context menu pops up.
If an unselected row is used, the current selection will be reset and only the
row below the mouse is selected.
.sp
The context menu allows to:
* select arrivals based on a certain criterion
* activate/deactivate selected arrivals
* delete selected arrivals

If arrivals are deleted, they are removed physically from this solution in
contrast to deactivate an arrival where only the weight is set to zero.
.SS Waveform review (Picker)
.sp
The \fIPicker\fP button opens the interactive waveform picker window. It allows
to pick additional phases, to confirm picks, to add additional pick information
such as polarity and uncertainty, to rotate traces and much more.
.sp
It is devided into 2 parts, the zoom trace and the trace list. The zoom trace
shows a sub area of the active trace in the list.

.sp
Initially the picker shows only the vertical channels for each station that
have been associated with the current location. It can be
\fI\%configured\fP to show all 3 components.
.sp
Initially the picker allows to pick the following phases:

.sp
This list can be customized and phases can be grouped to reflect e.g. regional
and teleseismic profiles. An example configuration looks like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Define two phase groups: regional and teleseismic
picker.phases.groups = regional, teleseismic

# Define all phases of group "regional"
picker.phases.groups.regional = Pn, P, Pg, PmP, P1, Sg, S, Sn, SmS

# Define all phases of group "teleseismic"
picker.phases.groups.teleseismic = pP, PKP, PKP

# Define a list of favourite phase for quick access
picker.phases.favourites = Pn, P, Pg, PmP, P1, Pg, Sg, S, Sn, SmS
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The list of favourites is used to assign shortcuts to. \fB1\fP is assigned
to the first phase, \fB2\fP to the second and so on.
.IP Note
Shortcuts are assigned only  to the first 9 favourite phases. All
other defined phases can be activated from the \fIPicking\fP menu.

To set the uncertainty of a pick a list of predefined uncertainties can be
defined. Additionally uncertainties can be defined freely whereas choosing
among a predefined set of uncertainties is a lot faster.
.sp
If the mouse hovers a pick a dashed rectangle is drawn around this pick. Then
the pick is active and the right mouse button can be pressed to open the context
menu where the polarity and uncertainty can be defined. The following screenshot
shows the available uncertainties.

# Define an uncertainty profile for teleseimis events
picker.uncertainties.profile.teleseismic = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, "(1,2)"

# Define the list of uncertainty sets that are active in scolv.
# This first set in the list is used by default. The other sets

The Magnitude tab shows all available magnitude information for the chosen
origin. For each of the different magnitude types (e.g. mb, mB, MLv, Mw(mB))
the station magnitudes are shown in the magnitude residual plot and the table.
The residual plot visualizes the difference between the station magnitude and
the network magnitude for the different station distances. After relocation the
magnitude can be recalculated by the "Compute Magnitudes" button in the
Location tab. Station magnitudes can be deselected for computation.
Normally, the 25%\-trimmed mean is calculated as network magnitude to stabilize
the result against a few outliers.

The initial view loads all traces of all arrivals within the defined distance
for that magnitude type. The zoom trace shows all components required for this
particular amplitude type and the lower part shows all stations and only the
currently active component. All traces are aligned on trigger time (blue P marker).
If a station has got an amplitude it shows up as a red (automatic
determined amplitude) or green (manually determined amplitude) marker.
This display is similar to the Picker.

The toolbar contains two lines of settings. The first line is similar to the
Picker, the second line is amplitude picker specific.

A station trace is divided into three areas:
\- dark gray: unused data
\- light gray: data used for noise offset and noise amplitude
\- white: data used for amplitude calculation
.sp
The example above shows nicely how different data time windows are used for
amplitude determination depending on the distance. This depends on the
amplitude type and its implementation.

By default the processed waveforms are displayed. To look at the raw waveforms
change the filter drop down box to \fIRaw\fP.
.SS Processing settings
.sp
A basic amplitude processor uses two basic settings: Minimum signal/noise
ratio (SNR) and data time windows. The default minimum snr is defined by the
implementation of the amplitude algorithm. This default snr is shown in the
toolbar right from \fIMin SNR:\fP. In some situations an operator might want to
increase or decrease the minimum snr for some reason. This can be done by
modifying the value in the corresponding spin box.
.sp
In the time scale of the zoom widget and the overview are three black triangles
visible. Those triangles can be used to adjust the data time windows of either
the zoom trace (upper part) or all traces (lower part) by dragging the handle
with the left mouse button.
.sp
Some amplitude processors allow the modification of the type of amplitude
measurement (e.g. absolute maximum or peak\-to\-peak) and/or the amplitude
combiner procedure. This procedure is mostly used when a final amplitude from
two components is computed, e.g. ML on the horizontals. The combiner procedure
defines how the amplitudes of each horizontal are combined to a single amplitude,
e.g. by taking the maximum of both or the average.
.sp
If the amplitude processor allows any of these options the corresponding drop
down boxes are enabled in the toolbar and can be used to change the defaults.
.IP Note
Amplitudes are not recalculated if any changes to the settings are
made. Recalculation has to be activated manually (see below).
.RE
.SS Secondary filters
.sp
Another option is to filter the data additionally to the internal filter of the
amplitude processor. Be warned that wrongly applied filters screw up the results.
The available filters can be defined in the settings dialog of scolv or in the
configuration file similar to the manual picker filters:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Define a list of available filters for amplitude picking.
# The format is "name1;filter\-definition1", "name2;filter\-definition2"
amplitudePicker.filters = "4 pole HP @2s;BW_HP(4,0.5)"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The new filter selection is applied immediately to the waveforms while the amplitudes are not recalculated
(see next section).
.SS Calculate amplitudes
.sp
To calculate the amplitudes of all traces with the current settings press the
green check in the toolbar. It will process all traces and recalculate the
amplitudes within the shown time windows. If an error occurs it will show up as
a small message box in the station trace itself. If a new amplitude is available
its state is set to manual and the marker is updated to reflect the new position
of the amplitude. If the mouse hovers an amplitude marker a tooltip pops up
after a certain amount of time and shows information about the amplitude.

.SS Remove bad stations
.sp
Stations can be disabled by either double clicking on the trace label in the
overview or by deactivating an amplitude similar to deactivating a pick.
.SS Confirm the amplitudes
.sp
The red button in the toolbar confirms all amplitudes and transfers them to the
magnitude review page. Only activated amplitudes are transfered. Disabled
stations or disabled amplitudes are ignored. At this stage all magnitudes are
calculated and the network magnitude is calculated according to the available
settings: \fIMean\fP, \fIMedian\fP or \fITrimmed mean\fP.

.SH CUSTOM QUANTITIES
.sp
Since the internal data model is limited, scolv allows to add custom quantities
derived from the origin objects to the information panel, to the origin list of
Event tab and to the Event list. This can help to evaluate origins in a better
way.
.sp
Two source are supported, origin comments and custom scripts.
.SS Origin comments
.sp
Currently on one comment can be added to the different panels.
.sp
To add a comment value to the information panel of the Location tab, the
following configuration can be used:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Define the comment id to be used
display.origin.comment.id = SED.quality

# Define the default display value if no comment is available
display.origin.comment.default = "\-"

# Define the label text in the information panel for this value
display.origin.comment.label = Quality
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To add a custom column to the origin list of the Event tab using a comment
value, the following configuration can be used:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Define the default value if no comment is present
eventedit.customColumn.default = "\-"

# Define the comment id to be used
eventedit.customColumn.originCommentID = SED.quality

# Define the column header label
eventedit.customColumn = "Qual"

# Define the column position in the table
eventedit.customColumn.pos = 4

# Allows to map comment values (strings) to colors. In this case the
# comment will have A,B,C or D which is mapped to green, yellow, orange and
# red
eventedit.customColumn.colors = "A:00FF00","B:rgb(64,192,0)",\e
                                "C:rgb(192,64,0)","D:FF0000"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To add a custom column to the event list of the Events tab using a comment
value, the following configuration can be used:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Define the default value if no comment is present
eventlist.customColumn.default = "\-"

# Define the comment id to be used
eventlist.customColumn.originCommentID = "SED.quality"

# Define the column header label
eventlist.customColumn = "Qual"

# Define the column position in the table
eventlist.customColumn.pos = 5

# Allows to map comment values (strings) to colors. In this case the
# comment will have A,B,C or D which is mapped to green, yellow, orange and
# red
eventlist.customColumn.colors = "A:00FF00","B:rgb(64,192,0)",\e
                                "C:rgb(192,64,0)","D:FF0000"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The last three examples are used to show the \fISED.quality\fP comment value which
is set by the \fINonLinLoc locator plugin\fP.
.SS External scripts
.sp
Another option to add derived origin parameters is to use external scripts.
scolv will call those scripts and writes a binary serialized origin object
to its standard input. scolv reads the script output and displays this value
only if the return code of the script is 0.
.sp
An example script which just returns the standard error looks like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#!/usr/bin/env python
import seiscomp3.DataModel, seiscomp3.IO

def main():
    ar = seiscomp3.IO.BinaryArchive()

    # Open standard input
    if not ar.open("\-"):
        # Hmmm, opening stdin failed
        return 1

    # Read the object
    obj = ar.readObject()
    ar.close()

    # Try to cast obj to an origin
    org = seiscomp3.DataModel.Origin.Cast(obj)

    # No origin \-> error
    if not org:
        return 1

    # Try to print the standard error to stdout
    try: print org.quality().standardError()
    # Field not set, return error
    except: return 1

    return 0

 if __name__ == "__main__":
     sys.exit(main())
.ft P
.fi
.IP Important
The script must be executable. In Linux don\(aqt forget
to call
.sp
.nf
.ft C
chmod +x /path/to/script
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.sp
As many scripts as necessary to evaluate can be created.
.IP Warning
Calling external scripts causes overhead and can take some time
depending on the implementation of the script. scolv needs to access the
database to fetch additional information which it does not need normally.
The slower the database access, the longer it takes to display the results.
.RE
.sp
To add the output to the information panel of the Location tab, the following
configuration can be used:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Define the available addons to be used
display.origin.addons = qual1, qual2

# Configure each addon
display.origin.addon.qual1.label = "Qual1"
display.origin.addon.qual1.script = "@CONFIGDIR@/scripts/scolv/qual1"

display.origin.addon.qual2.label = "Qual2"
display.origin.addon.qual2.script = "@CONFIGDIR@/scripts/scolv/qual2"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The same can be done for the origin list of the Event tab
.sp
.nf
.ft C
eventedit.scripts.columns = qual1, qual2
eventedit.scripts.column.qual1.label = "Qual1"
eventedit.scripts.column.qual1.pos = 8
eventedit.scripts.column.qual1.script = "@CONFIGDIR@/scripts/scolv/qual1"
eventedit.scripts.column.qual2.label = "Qual2"
eventedit.scripts.column.qual2.pos = 9
eventedit.scripts.column.qual2.script = "@CONFIGDIR@/scripts/scolv/qual2"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
and for the event list of the Events tab
.sp
.nf
.ft C
eventlist.scripts.columns = qual1, qual2
eventlist.scripts.column.qual1.label = "Qual1"
eventlist.scripts.column.qual1.pos = 5
eventlist.scripts.column.qual1.script = "@CONFIGDIR@/scripts/scolv/qual1"
eventlist.scripts.column.qual2.label = "Qual2"
eventlist.scripts.column.qual2.pos = 6
eventlist.scripts.column.qual2.script = "@CONFIGDIR@/scripts/scolv/qual2"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Adding external scripts to the event list is the most expensive part. Whenever
the event list is reloaded, it will start to run the scripts on all origins
in the background. It can take a while until the complete list has been
processed. A progress indicator is plotted in the middle of the event list while
the background processes are running.
