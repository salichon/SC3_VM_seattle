\fBtab to sc3 inventory converter\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The tab2inv program is part of the nettab package distributed together with the SeisComp3 package. The nettab is a text based format developed inside the GEOFON data center to describe seismological instruments responses information. The tab2inv program can generate SeisComp3 inventory files from the parsing of the tab files as described by in the nettab format.
.sp
This program read a set of files in the nettab format, verify the files content and generate the inventory for the stations described in the tab files.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-default

This option help to set parameters that you want to be set on all objects.

This option allow the prefixing of the instrument (Dataloger or Sensor) name attribute on the inventory generated by a prefix. This option is normally used when you want to convert many networks that share the same instrumentation in different calls of the program. In each call of the program you can supply the network code and year as padding to guarantee that the instruments generated in both runs of the program will have different name values that are used as Key on the SeisComp3 inventory.
