**tab to sc3 inventory converter**


Description
===========

The tab2inv program is part of the nettab package distributed together with the SeisComp3 package. The nettab is a text based format developed inside the GEOFON data center to describe seismological instruments responses information. The tab2inv program can generate SeisComp3 inventory files from the parsing of the tab files as described by in the nettab format.

This program read a set of files in the nettab format, verify the files content and generate the inventory for the stations described in the tab files.



Command-line
============

.. program:: tab2inv

:program:`tab2inv [options] tab-file [more-tab-file]`


Options
-------

.. option:: -h, --help

   Prints a small program help and exit

.. option:: -f, --filterf

   Indicate the filter folder. The filter folder is where the program will search for the files indicated by the Ff and If lines.

.. option:: -x, --xmlf

   Indicate a folder containing a set of XML files that contains the SeisComp3 inventory files that will be used to resolve the station groups. Normally this folder is the seiscomp3\/etc\/inventory folder.

.. option:: -D, --database


.. option:: -f, --force

   Don't stop on errors of individual files. Try to perform the requested task even that some files contain formatting errors.

.. option:: -g, --generate

   This option instruct the program to generate the XML document in the end of processing. When you don't supply this option the file is just parsed and loaded into objects in the memory.

.. option:: -c, --check

   Perform some tests after the files can be loaded. The tests include testing that the instruments all can be resolved and has no unused instruments supplied.

.. option:: -d, --default

   Use this option to indicate a default file. A default file is a file containing normally a set of rules for Network \(Na\), Stations \(Sa\) and Instruments \(Ia\) that are applied for every object created before the attributes specified in the file are applied. This option help to set parameters that you want to be set on all objects.

.. option:: -o, --output

   Use this option to indicate the output filename for the XML file, if not indicated the program will write the output file to the STDOUT.

.. option:: -i, --ip

   This option allow the prefixing of the instrument \(Dataloger or Sensor\) name attribute on the inventory generated by a prefix. This option is normally used when you want to convert many networks that share the same instrumentation in different calls of the program. In each call of the program you can supply the network code and year as padding to guarantee that the instruments generated in both runs of the program will have different name values that are used as Key on the SeisComp3 inventory.
