**Map view.**


Description
===========

scmv visualizes the actual information regarding earthquakes, trigger status,
ground motion and station quality. This information is visualized in a map
showing also the topography of the region including bathymetry, state borders
and geologic faults. scmv provides two different tabs with maps showing the
ground motion and the network status.

The ground motion tab (fig. :ref:`fig-scmv-gm`) shows the actual groundmotion
in nm/s at each station color-coded. Furthermore the trigger status (new picks)
of the stations are announced by blinking triangles (the same in all
other tabs). In case a new pick is associated to an event, the blinking color
changes from red to green (default). Events are represented by open circles
and the depth is color-coded. By right mouse click on the symbol of a station
more detailed information are shown in an information widget (fig. :ref:`fig-scmv-infowidget`).

   Ground motion tab

   Tab 1-2 = Ground Motion, Network Status tab; Station A = station with ground
   motion between 0 and 200 nm/s; Station B = triggering (red blinking) station;
   Station C = station of undefined status; Station D = triggering and associated
   station (green blinking); EQ = location of the earthquake/event; P = spreading
   of the P-wave; S = spreading of the S-wave; Legend = ground motion scale.


The network status tab (fig. :ref:`fig-scmv-netstat`) visualizes the timing quality
of the whole seismic network. The colors of the triangles represent the data
latencies/delay of the station. More detailed information about station quality
can be derived by opening an information widget (fig. :ref:`fig-scmv-infowidget` left)
with a right mouse click on the symbol.

.. _fig-scmv-netstat:

.. figure:: media/scmv/netstat.png
   :width: 16cm
   :align: center

   Network status tab

   Station A = station with up to 20 sec data latency/delay;
   Station B = station with up to 10 min data latency/delay and a warning;
   Station C = disabled station;
   EQ = location of a recent or historic earthquake/event;
   Legend = scale of the delay;
   Status = connection status.


In addition to the current event scmv can show all events it has currently
saved in its session. This depends on the configured time span it remembers
events. This can give a nice overview of the network activity. The circles
are again colored by depth and sized by magnitude.

.. _fig-scmv-historic-origins:

.. figure:: media/scmv/historic-origins.png
   :width: 16cm
   :align: center

   Show historic origins

   All historic origins currently saved in scmv are shown as circles.


The information widget opens by right mouse click on a station or event symbol
in one of the scmv maps. The widget gives a more detailed list of parameters.
For a station general information (coordinates, network code etc.), quality
parameter (latency, gaps etc.), amplitude information and the actual waveform
data are provided. For an event information like the location, the number of
stations and the azimuthal gap are shown.

   Info widget

   The info widget of a station shows station information like network code
   and location. The quality of the station can be checked here. The lower
   part shows the last 15 minutes of waveforms including picks (if available).
