**SeisComP kernel.**


Description
===========

The kernel is the basic configuration for the :command:`seiscomp` tool.
It contains configuration parameters for all init scripts in :file:`etc/init`. Each init script can, but does not
need to, read the kernel parameters and configure itself accordingly. Kernel parameters are not mandatory but
should be taken as (serious) hints. If for example syslog is enabled in the kernel then all init scripts should
configure syslog as logging backend for the programs they start. But if a program does not support syslog it can
also be started without logging to syslog.



Configuration
=============


.. note::

   kernel is a standalone module and does not inherit :ref:`global options <global-configuration>`.


| :file:`etc/defaults/kernel.cfg`
| :file:`etc/kernel.cfg`
| :file:`~/.seiscomp3/kernel.cfg`



.. confval:: syslog

   Type: *boolean*

   Sends all logging output to the syslog backend which logs
   usually to \/var\/log\/messages.
   Default is ``false``.

.. _kernel/syncarc:


syncarc extension
-----------------

SeisComP EIDA inventory synchronization component.


.. confval:: inventory.syncOnUpdate

   Type: *boolean*

   Enables\/disables the synchronization of the inventory
   after a update\-config is called. When enabled this will
   call the sync_arc program everytime that the seiscomp
   update\-config is used
   Default is ``false``.

.. _kernel/messaging:


messaging extension
-------------------

SeisComP messaging component that enables communication of modules over the network.


.. confval:: messaging.enable

   Type: *boolean*

   Enables\/disables local messaging \(spread+scmaster\).
   The messaging component is an integral component
   of all modules \(except eg acquisition modules\).
   If you are not sure what to do, enable it.
   Default is ``true``.

.. confval:: messaging.port

   Type: *port*

   Defines the messaging port. The default port
   is 4803 and the messaging connection for
   all modules running locally is localhost:4803.
