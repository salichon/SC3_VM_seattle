**Import/export MiniSEED data to/from SDS archives.**


Description
===========

The archive tool scart creates playback files (multiplexed MiniSEED files) from
SDS structured data (e.g. created by slarchive) or from data passed from
another record source such as :ref:`Arclink <arclink>`. It can also playback
records directly out of an SDS structure. Furthermore it can be used to import
multiplexed MiniSEED files into a local SDS structure.
So it is possible to save event based waveform data in combination with
scevtstreams into another archive.



Command-line
============

.. program:: scart

:program:`scart [options] {archive-dir}`

The last option has to be the archive directory when dump mode is enabled.
When no archive directory is explicitly given,
\$SEISCOMP_ROOT\/acquisition\/archive or the current directory
is used depending on whether \$SEISCOMP_ROOT has been set or not.
The default operation mode is import. That means that a multiplexed
MiniSEED file or another record source such as ArcLink is used to import
records into a SDS structure.

.. option:: -I

   Specify the recordstream URL when in import mode.
   When using another recordstream than a file \(like ArcLink\) a stream
   list file is required \(default is file:\/\/\- \(stdin\)\)

.. option:: -t timewindow

   Specify the time window \(as one properly quoted string\) to dump
   records for. Times are UTC and separated by a tilde \"\~\".
   To dump one hour of waveform data between 2008\/01\/01 00:00:00 and
   2008\/01\/01 01:00:00 use
   <\-t \"2008\-01\-01 00:00:00\~2008\-01\-01 01:00:00\">.

.. option:: -d, --dump

   Set export \(dump\) mode. Records are fetched from an archive and
   stored in a file \(or pipe\).

.. option:: -l, --list file

   Uses a stream list file instead of defined networks and channels
   \(\-n and \-c are ignored\). Line format: starttime;endtime;streamID.
   The time format is the same as described in option '\-t'.

.. option:: -s, --sort

   Sort records by [start\-]time. To sort records by their endtime use \-E.

.. option:: -E

   Sort records according to their end time \(default is start time\).

.. option:: -m, --modify

   Modify the record time for real time playback when in export mode.
   The first record time is NOW. The relative time of successive records
   to the first one are kept.

.. option:: --speed

   Specify the speed to dump the records. A value of 0 means no delay
   otherwise speed is a multiplier of the real time difference between
   the records. When feeding the records directly into the replay pipe
   a value of 1 \(real time\) is recommended.

.. option:: -n networks

   Network list of networks to dump \(comma separated\) \(default is \*\).

.. option:: -c channels

   Specify the channel filter for the dumped streams as regular
   expression \(default is \(B\|S\|M\|H\)\(L\|H\)\(Z\|N\|E\)\). To dump only the
   BHZ, BHN and BHE streams use BH\(Z\|N\|E\).

.. option:: --files count

   Specify the number of file handles to cache \(default is 100\).

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Verbose mode.

.. option:: --test

   Test mode, no record output. This switch is useful for debugging.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Display a help message.
