depend on the direction of wave propagation with respect to fault orientation and slip
direction (radiation pattern). The directivity and thus the radiation pattern is different for

which contains information about earthquake parameters.</li>

</dd>
<dt id="term-fault-plane-solution">fault-plane solution</dt>
<dd>Representation of the fault activated in an earthquake and the caused direction of slip on the fault by
a circle with two intersecting curves looking like a beach ball. A fault-plane solution is found by the
analysis of seismic records at many stations of an earthquake to obtain the radiation pattern. From the
radiation pattern the fault parameter and the slip direction are determined using a stereographic
projection or its mathematical equivalent. The most common analysis uses the direction of first motion
of P wave onsets and yields two possible orientations for the fault rupture and the direction of seismic
slip. Another technique is to use the polarization of teleseismic <a class="reference internal" href="#term-s-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">S waves</em></a> and/or to measure amplitude
ratios between different phase types. Further inferences can be made from these data concerning the
principal axes of stress in the region of the earthquake. The principal stress axes determined by this
method are the compressional axis (also called the P-axis, i.e. the axis of greatest compression, or s1),
the tensional axis (also known as the T-axis, i.e., the axis of least compression, or s3), and the
intermediate axis (s2).</dd>
<dt id="term-filter-ing">filter(ing)</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A filter attenuates certain frequencies of a (seismic) signal and amplifies others. The process of
filtering can be accomplished electronically while recording or numerically in a computer. Filtering also
occurs naturally as seismic energy passes through the Earth.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="term-first-motion">first motion</dt>
<dd>The first noticeable displacement in a seismogram caused by the arrival of a P wave at the seismometer.
Upward motion of the ground at the seismometer indicates a dilatation at the source, downward motion
indicates a compression. Due to the presence of seismic noise the proper polarity of the first motion
may be difficult to recognize.</dd>

<dd>see <a class="reference internal" href="#term-fault-plane-solution"><em class="xref std std-term">fault-plane solution</em></a></dd>
<dt id="term-foreshocks">foreshocks</dt>
<dd>Earthquakes that occur in a series of earthquakes before the largest earthquake, termed the mainshock.
Foreshocks may precede the mainshock by seconds to weeks and usually originate at or near the focus
of the larger earthquake. Not all mainshocks have foreshocks.</dd>
<dt id="term-fourier-spectrum">Fourier spectrum</dt>
<dd>The relative amplitudes (and phase angles) at different frequencies that are derived from a time series
by Fourier analysis.</dd>
<dt id="term-fourier-analysis">Fourier analysis</dt>
<dd>The mathematical operation that resolves a time series (for example, a recording of ground motion)
into a series of numbers that characterize the relative amplitude and phase components of the signal
as a function of frequency.</dd>
<dt id="term-frequency-domain">frequency domain</dt>
<dd>The transformation of a seismic signal from the time domain (as a seismogram) to the frequency
domain is conducted by a Fourier analysis. The signal is represented in the frequency domain by
the amplitude and phase components as a function of frequency (see spectrum). The representations of
a seismic signal in the time and in the frequency domain are equivalent in a mathematical sense.
For some procedures of data analysis the time-domain representation of a seismic record is more
suitable while for others the frequency-domain approach is more appropriate and efficient.</dd>
<dt id="term-geometrical-spreading">geometrical spreading</dt>
<dd>The component of reduction in wave amplitude due to the radial spreading of seismic energy with
increasing distance from a given source.</dd>
<dt id="term-green-s-function">Green's function</dt>
<dd>A mathematical representation that, in reference to earthquake shaking, is used to represent the
ground motion caused by instantaneous slip on a small part of a fault. Greenâs functions can be
summed over a large fault surface to compute the ground shaking for a large earthquake rupturing
a fault of finite size. The fractional fault-slip events that are summed can be records from
small earthquakes on the fault or they can be theoretically computed small-earthquake records.</dd>
<dt id="term-gutenberg-discontinuity">Gutenberg discontinuity</dt>
<dd>The seismic velocity discontinuity marking the core-mantle boundary (CMB) at which the velocity
of P waves drops from about 13.7 km/s to about 8.0 km/s and the velocity of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-s-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">S waves</em></a> drops from
about 7.3 km/s to 0 km/s. The CMB reflects the change from the solid mantle material to the
fluid outer core.</dd>
<dt id="term-hypocenter">hypocenter</dt>
<dd>Coordinates of an earthquake point source. Hypocenters based on <a class="reference internal" href="#term-p-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">P</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-s-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">S wave</em></a>
first arrivals point to the place where the rupture process starts. For large earthquakes the
source location determined by <a class="reference internal" href="#term-p-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">P wave</em></a> first arrivals can differ significantly from the location of
maximum energy release.</dd>
<dt id="term-intensity">intensity</dt>
<dd>A measure of the effects of an earthquake at a particular place at the Earth's surface on humans
and (or) structures. The intensity at a point depends not only upon the strength of the earthquake
(magnitude) but also upon the distance from the earthquake, the depth of the hypocenter and the
local geology at that point. Several scales exist, most of them giving the intensity in 12 degrees,
usually written as Roman numerals. Most frequently used are at present the European Macroseismic
Scale (EMS-98), and in the United States the Modified Mercalli scale and the Rossi-Forel scale.
There are many different intensity values for one earthquake, depending on how far you are away
from the epicenter; this is unlike the magnitude value, which is one number for each earthquake
as a measure of the amount of seismic wave energy released by it.</dd>
<dt id="term-interplate-intraplate">interplate/intraplate</dt>
<dd>Intraplate pertains to processes within the Earth's crustal plates. Interplate pertains to
processes between the plates.</dd>
<dt id="term-interplate-coupling">interplate coupling</dt>
<dd>The qualitative ability of a subduction thrust fault to lock and accumulate stress. Strong
interplate coupling implies that the fault is locked and capable of accumulation stress whereas
weak coupling implies that the fault is unlocked or only capable of accumulating low stress.
A fault with weak interplate coupling could be aseismic or could slip by creep.</dd>
<dt id="term-latency">latency</dt>
<dd>The time difference between the current time and the arrival time of the record. (SeisComP3)</dd>
<dt id="term-lithosphere">Lithosphere</dt>
<dd>The outer solid part of the Earth, including crust and uppermost mantle. The lithosphere is
about 100 km thick, although its thickness is age-dependent (older lithosphere is thicker).
At some locations the lithosphere below the crust is brittle enough to produce earthquakes by
faulting, such as within a subducted oceanic plate.</dd>
<dt id="term-love-wave">Love wave</dt>
<dd>A major type of surface waves having a horizontal motion that is transverse (or perpendicular)
to the direction of propagation. It is named after A. E. H. Love, the English mathematician
who discovered it.</dd>
<dt id="term-leaky-mode">leaky mode</dt>
<dd>A seismic surface wave which is imperfectly trapped, e.g., within a low-velocity layer or a
sequence of layers, so that its energy leaks or escapes across a layer boundary causing some
attenuation.</dd>
<dt id="term-low-velocity-layer-zone">low-velocity layer/zone</dt>
<dd>Any layer in the Earth in which seismic wave velocities are lower than in the layers above and below.</dd>
<dt id="term-magnification-curve">magnification curve</dt>
<dd>A diagram showing the dependence of amplification, e.g. of the seismic ground motion by a
seismograph, as a function of frequency.</dd>
<dt id="term-magnitude">magnitude</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A number that characterizes the relative size of an earthquake. The magnitude is based on
measurement of the maximum motion recorded by a seismograph (sometimes for waves of a particular frequency),
corrected for the attenuation with distance. Several scales have been defined, but the most commonly used are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>local magnitude (ML), commonly referred to as &quot;Richter magnitude&quot;</li>
<li>surface-wave magnitude (Ms)</li>
<li>body-wave magnitude (mb)</li>
<li>moment magnitude (Mw).</li>
</ol>
<p class="last">The magnitude scales 1-3 have limited range and applicability and do not satisfactorily measure the
size of the largest earthquakes. The moment magnitude (Mw) scale, based on the concept of seismic moment,
is uniformly applicable to all earthquake sizes but is more difficult to compute than the other types. In
principal, all magnitude scales could be cross calibrated to yield the same value for any given earthquake, but
this expectation has proven to be only approximately true, thus the magnitude type as well as its value
is needed to be specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-magnitude-local-ml">magnitude, local (ML)</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Magnitude scale introduced by Richter in the early 1930s (Richter, 1935) to have a common scale for the
strength of earthquakes. The basic observation is the systematic decay of the logarithm of the maximum
amplitudes with increasing distance for different earthquakes described by:</p>

<p><img src="../_images/math/148956ae35c06a492414ec2dafffa57ef04a0e39.png" alt="ML = \log A_{max} - \log A_0"/></p>
</div><p>with A<sub>0</sub> as amplitude of a reference event. For the reference event ML = 0 the formula can be rewritten to</p>

<p><img src="../_images/math/bd870ff195f50381959331ce07b851a0a2d5944d.png" alt="ML = \log A_{max} - 2.48 + 2.76 \log \Delta"/></p>
</div><p>with Î being the distance of the station to the earthquake location. ML is a magnitude scale for
recordings of earthquakes smaller than ML 7 at regional stations. It is usually a measure of the
regional-distance S-wave on horizontal component records.
The original formula is only valid for records from a Wood-Anderson torsion seismometer with a natural period of
0.8 s and shallow earthquakes in California. Therefore calibration functions for other regions and wider
depth ranges are necessary. A Wood-Anderson seismometer has to be simulated. For amplitudes measurements
on the vertical component records additional correction factors has to be applied. ML saturates at
magnitudes around 7 because the maximum amplitudes of larger earthquakes occur at longer periods than
the bandpass of 0.1 s and 3 s for the magnitude calculation.</p>
<p class="last">In SeisComP3 a modified local magnitude Mlv is determined by simulation of a Wood-Anderson instrument and then measuring
the amplitude in a 150 s time window on the vertical component of station with distances smaller than 8Â°.</p>

<dt id="term-magnitude-body-wave-mb">magnitude, body-wave (mb)</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Magnitude developed for teleseismic body waves. mb is defined on the amplitude of the first few cycles of the P-wave,
typically a time window of 20 s - 30 s. Only the first few cycles are used to minimize the effects of radiation pattern
and depth phases, which result in complicate waveform signatures. The general formula is</p>

</div><p>with A as the displacement amplitude in micrometers, T as the dominant period of the signal in seconds, Q as a
correction term for depth and distance. mb is usually determined at periods around 1s in adaptation to the use
of the World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network (WWSSN) short-period stations. A scatter in the order of +/- 0.3
for the station magnitudes is usual. Typically, mb is determined for stations with distances larger than 5Â° to
have a distinct direct P-wave phase. A correction term for the distance has to be determined empirically, which
is quite complicate for distances smaller than 20Â°. This reflects the complexity of the body waves that traverse
only in the upper mantle. mb saturates at about magnitude 5.5 to 6.0 because the maximum amplitudes of larger
earthquakes occur at lower frequencies than the frequency range between 0.7 Hz - 2 Hz used for the magnitude
calculation.</p>
<p class="last">In SeisComP3 mb is determined by simulation of a WWSSN short-period seismometer and then measuring the amplitudes in
a 30 s time window at stations in the distance range of 5Â° to 105Â°.</p>

<dt id="term-magnitude-broadband-body-wave-mb">magnitude, broadband body-wave (mB)</dt>
<dd><p class="first">mB is a magnitude based on body waves like mb, but the amplitude is measured in a broad
frequency range and longer time windows. Instead of amplitude measurements on displacement
data together with the dominant period, the maximum velocity amplitude Vmax is taken
directly from velocity-proportional records with V = 2ÏA/T. The time window for the
measurement can be determined by the duration of the high-frequency (1-3 Hz) radiation
(Bormann &amp; Saul, 2008). This time window usually contains the phases P, pP, sP, PcP, but
not PP. According to the long time window and broad frequency range used for amplitude
measurements mB saturates not like mb.</p>

at stations in the distance range of 5Â° to 105Â°.</p>

<p class="last">The general nomenclature for P waves: At local and
regional distances a special nomenclature is used to describe the travel path of
the first P and S arrivals. Pg, Pb/P* and Pn phases are separated. Pg is the direct
P wave arriving first in distances less than around 100 km. Pn is the head wave
along the Moho arriving first at larger distances than 100 km (depending on the
crustal thickness). Pn has usually smaller amplitudes than Pg. Pb or P* is the
rarely observed head wave travelling along the midcrustal velocity discontinuity.
The general nomenclature of P waves entitles reflections at the topside of boundaries
with lowercase letters (m â Moho reflection; c - CMB reflection; i - inner core-outer
core boundary reflection), e.g. PmP is a reflected P wave at the Moho. Reflections
at the bottomside of boundaries get no additional letter, e.g. PP is a reflected
P wave at the Earth's surface. Refracted rays get capital letters (K - through
the outer core; I - through the inner core), e.g. PKIKP is a P wave traversing
the crust/mantle, the outer core, the inner core, again the outer core and again
the mantle/crust.</p>

<dt id="term-s-wave">S wave</dt>
<dd><p class="first">S (secondary) waves are shear waves without any volumetric variation in the media.
The sense of particle motion is perpendicular to the propagation direction. S waves
are body waves that traverse the interior of a body but can not propagate in fluids.</p>
<p class="last">Analog to the P arrivals Sg, Sb/S<sup>*</sup> and Sn arrivals are distinguished in local
and regional distances. The general nomenclature of S waves is analog to the P waves.
The reflections at the topside of boundaries have lowercase letters (m - Moho
reflection; c - CMB reflection), e.g. SmS is a reflected S wave at the Moho.
Reflections at the bottomside of boundaries get no additional letter, e.g. SS is a
reflected S wave at the Earth's surface. Refracted rays get capital letters (J - through
the inner core), e.g. SKJKS is a S wave traversing the crust/mantle, the outer core
as a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-p-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">P wave</em></a>, the inner core as a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-s-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">S wave</em></a>, again the outer core as a P wave and again
the mantle/crust as S wave. S waves can not travel through the outer core because
the outer core consists of a fluid.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-surface-wave">surface wave</dt>
<dd>Surface waves are seismic waves observed only at the free surface of the media.
Two types of surface waves are distinguished: <a class="reference internal" href="#term-love-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">Love waves</em></a> (L)
and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-rayleigh-wave"><em class="xref std std-term">Rayleigh waves</em></a> (R).
Both result from the interaction of P and S waves near the free surface.</dd>
<dt id="term-waveform-data">waveform (data)</dt>
<dd>The complete analog or sufficiently dense sampled digital representation of a
continuous wave group (e.g., of a seismic phase) or of a whole wave train
(seismogram). Accordingly, waveform data allow to reconstruct and analyze the
whole seismic phase or earthquake record both in the time and frequency domain
whereas parameter data describe the signal only by a very limited number of more
or less representative measurements such as onset time, maximum signal amplitude
and related period.</dd>
<dt id="term-waveformid">waveformID</dt>
<dd>Attribute of the QuakeML objects Pick, !StationAmplitude and !StationMagnitude
describing the source of the underlying waveform source. The WaveformID contains
information about the !NetworkCode, !StationCode, !LocationCode and !ChannelCode</dd>
<dt id="term-wave-front">wave front</dt>
<dd>The surface formed by all elements of a propagating wave, which swing in phase;
the wave front is perpendicular to the seismic rays, which are oriented in
direction of wave propagation.</dd>
<dt id="term-wavelength">wavelength</dt>
<dd>The distance between successive points of equal amplitude and phase on a
wave (for example, crest to crest or trough to trough).</dd>
<dt id="term-weight">weight</dt>
<dd>Attribute of the QuakeML objects Arrival and !MagnitudeReferences defining the
effect of the referenced object (e.g. Pick).</dd>
